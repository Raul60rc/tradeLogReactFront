      <p>
        Wall St Baller started out in 2021 27th of January to bring the most
        real content out in the internet, by how showing how real hedge funds
        work from the inside with how they are really operating. We started to
        showcase our knowledge with our Youtube Channel which has enlighted the
        people regarding options & how the real Billionaires of this world play
        & gamble with their money responsibly in the financial markets. More
        than options trading or trading in general our principal goal has been
        that people realise how wealth is really created by just owning stock of
        a company that has solid product with great revenues & earnings. We look
        & aim for growth stocks where the revenues are growing by 25% each
        quarter, our goal is to own growth that becomes value in the future.
